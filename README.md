After installing **Android Oreo [8.1]** on my **OnePlus X**,  I realized that OpenGapps has not yet released any GAPPS packages for 8.1. Their latest official build is for 8.0

This is screenshot was taken on **22nd December 2017** and there was no GAPPS package for 8.1 thus **THIS REPO WAS BORN**.

I won't get time to build packages everyday but I'll update those package every once in a while. I'll also make sure that packages for **latest android API level** is ready for download so that flashoholics can run their phones till OpenGApps team releases official packages.

# Unofficial builds to the rescue!

Of course these packages are not as stable as the official builds but in the absence of official packages these will get the job done and can be installed on any android smartphone running **Android Oreo [8.1]**. My builds are available in **4 variants** which are -

1. pico
1. nano
1. micro
1. mini
1. stock [on request]
1. aroma [on request]

I haven't built any other variant because I don't know why would someone waste that much space by installing apps which are hardly used. I have built for **2 architectures** which are

1. arm [build 2018-01-05]
1. arm64 [build 2018-01-05]

If you need package of a different variant or architecture, let me know and I'll build one for you.
